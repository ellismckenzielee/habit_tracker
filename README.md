# Habit Tracker

## About

A simple web-based application that allows the user to perform the following actions:

```
- Create an account
- Login
- Add a habit
- Delete a habit
- Pair with another user
```

I wanted to explore a bunch of different technologies in this project:

```
- Typescript
- JWT Tokens
- Passport JS
- Bcrypt
```
